<p>For my experiences, I would like to tell you about my experience during my industry training for 
the last semester break. For your information, each student from my course will have an industry training 
before entering semester 4. What we need to do is choose any libraries that we will do the industry training 
and work there for six weeks. From there we can learn the workflow and activity that the libraries conduct for that time. </p>

<br>
<p>For me, I have chosen Perbadanan Perpustakaan Awam Kedah for my industry training because it is 
near with my house. I have learned many things about the library from the first day of my industry training. 
I have learned all of the function and activities for each department and know how it work because I have 
been to each department of the library. There are circulation department, acquisition department, 
cataloguing department, Koleksi Kedah department, reference and multimedia department and literacy department. </p>

<br>
<p>From all of the department, I like to work at circulation department and literacy department. It is 
because I can know and interact with users and join many activities that the library held. For example, 
I have joined the program called Sehari Bersama Perpustakaan that was held at Dewan Seri Negeri at Kedah. 
There are many activities that the library held during that day such as quizzes, storytelling, VR games, 
colouring contest and more. I was able to participate on that day and I was handling the quizzes activity. 
It is one of my best experience during my diploma study.</p>
