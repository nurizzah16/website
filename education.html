      I started my education at Sekolah Kebangsaan Kampong Gelam which is my primary school. I went there from 
      seven years old to twelve years old. I went to that school because it is near with my house. For the final year 
      examination which is UPSR I have got straight A for that examination.</pre></p>

      For my secondary school, I went to Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Sultanah Asma. It is a girls school which all 
      students are girls, but we have male teachers as well. I studied at that school since form 1 until form 5. For the 
      final examination in form 3 which is PT3, I have got 8 As from 10 subjects. For the final examination on my last 
      year at that school I have got 5 As from 10 subjects from that exam called SPM.</pre></p>

      After that, I continued my studies in Diploma of Library Management at UiTM Kedah. I am enjoying my studies 
      there because I can have new environment in studying. I am now on my final semester of diploma. I hope that 
      I can pass my final semester with flying colours.</pre></p>
